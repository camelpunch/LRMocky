# Mocky, an Objective-C mock object library

Mocky is an Objective-C mock object library based on the [jMock](http://jmock.org) Java library. It was built with the following goals in mind:

* An API that matches the jMock API as closely as possible
* Works out of the box with SenTestCase, allow adapters for other testing frameworks
* Support for Objective-C blocks
* Hamcrest matcher support built right in
* Sequences and state support

## A simple example

Mocky is still in the early stages of development; the best way of getting an idea of what features are supported is to take a look at the functional tests. Here's a simple example that expects a method to be called.

    - (void)testCanExpectSingleMethodCallAndPass;
    {
      LRMockery *context = [LRMockery mockeryForSenTestCase:self];
      SimpleObject *testObject = [context mock:[SimpleObject class]];

      [context checking:^(LRExpectationBuilder *that){
        [[that oneOf:testObject] doSomething];
      }];

      [testObject doSomething];
      [context assertSatisfied];
    }

Mocks can also be configured to return values:

    [context checking:^(LRExpectationBuilder *that){
      [[that oneOf:testObject] doSomething]; [that will:returnObject(someObject)];
    }];
    
    assertThat([testObject doSomething], equalTo(someObject));
    
Or perform a block:

    id outsideTheBlock = nil;

    [context checking:^(LRExpectationBuilder *that){
      [[that oneOf:testObject] doSomething]; [that will:performBlock(^(NSInvocation *invocation) {
        outsideTheBlock = @"called the block"
      })];
    }];
    
    [context assertSatisfied];
    [testObject doSomething];
    
    assertThat(outsideTheBlock, equalTo(@"called the block"));
    
## Credits and Licence

This library would not exist if it were not for jMock and all of [it's contributors](http://www.jmock.org/team.html), so thanks to them. 

Also a massive thanks to Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce for their excellent book [Growing Object Oriented Software, Guided by Tests](http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com/) which not only introduced me to jMock but is a great example of how to do TDD with mock objects well. I highly recommend you buy this book if you want to improve your TDD skills.

A version of the AuctionSniper application developed in the book that I developed using iOS/Objective-C can be found [here](http://github.com/lukeredpath/iPhoneAuctionSniper).
